### Finance Calculators 

A program which calculates a money amount using either investment or bond calculations, with the former also enabling to calculate via simple or compound interest. This program was made during the early stages of the bootcamp so I was not instructed to include common coding techniques such as error-handling or menu inputting with 'while' loops.

### Student Register

A very small program which asks the user to type in how many students are registering for an exam and tells them to type in the ID number for each student. It will then output a textfile called reg_form.txt which lists out every student ID number with a dotted line beside each one on which each student can tick to declare that they are present. Once you are running this program it is important that your terminal is not in a working directory different to the program file otherwise you will not know where the textfile has ended up.

### Email

A small email handling software which enables the user to read emails and check those which are unread. This program features Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and user-defined functions.
